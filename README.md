# Fields of Experts for Network Inversion and Adversarial Resoration

This repository contains the Tensorflow code for my master thesis. Over time, I will try to make some useful parts of it more accessible. For now, you can find the report [here](https://github.com/frhrdr/deep_restoration/blob/master/latex/MSc%20Thesis%20Frederik%20Harder.pdf).

The **Thesis-Submission** branch contains the state of the project from January 5. for evaluation purposes.
